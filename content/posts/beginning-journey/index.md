I'm starting this site as a place to document my journey into game development. As a web developer, I already have experience with coding, but game development requires a broader set of skills that I'm excited to explore.

## What I'll Be Learning

1. **Game Development**: Starting with Godot, its free and open source and seems like an intuitive engine. 
2. **Digital Art / Drawing**: Learning to draw first and later delve into creating game assets and animations
3. **Music Production**: Creating background music and sound effects
4. **Creative Writing**: Developing storylines and game narratives

This site will serve as my digital garden - a place where I can plant ideas, watch them grow, and share my progress along the way.
