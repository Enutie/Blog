**250 boxes. It is indeed a lot, but why did it take me 6 months?**

## Submitted my work for review

My wife don't understand it, why are you drawing boxes? Sometimes I wonder that myself. But I have finally done it. Its liberating and now I feel kinda weird not stressing about boxes no more.

I have tried to balance this challenge with the 50% rule. The rule is very clear - you have to spend *at least* 50 % of your time drawing on play. 

Play you think? That sounds easy! Well I assure you, IT IS NOT. It was so much easier to just take in some instructions and then follow them or take a reference and try and draw that too. But that is not play, that is study/course work. 

That resulted in me taking a long time completing this challenge and to be honest, I still have a lot of play time I need to catch up on. I have dabbled in digital as well and even got a cheap wacom drawing tablet and now that I am waiting for my feedback, I will draw some play stuff - it will indeed suck, but that is okay, I wont get any better if I don't do it.

See you in lesson 2!
