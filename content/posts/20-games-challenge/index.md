So every story has its beginnings, but where to start? I have watched countless youtube videos about indie game development and there seems to be a consensus saying 'Start small!' and 'Don't make your dream game as the first game!'

So what do I do then? I found [The 20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/). The premise is that you start out small with games like pong or flappy bird and slowly work your way up to more complex games.

This is also a way out of 'tutorial hell' where you don't essentially know how to do anything without having a tutorial to follow, here you have to use the documentation and experimentation, alternatively you can ask other people for help, but no tutorials! I like this approach and I will try and follow it, to further develop my knowledge and skills.
