**Game #1 of the 20 Games Challenge - A classic Pong clone made with Godot Engine!**

This is the first game in my journey to complete the 20 Games Challenge using Godot Engine. Pong is a perfect starting point - it's simple yet teaches fundamental game development concepts like collision detection, player input, and basic AI.
