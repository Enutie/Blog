Greetings {visitor} (I do not expect anyone reads this, so I suppose its a post just for me).
I have to confess something - I am not very consistent. I seem to have loads of projects, ideas or skill that I want to work on.
What is even worse is the AI boom that is happening at the moment. It is super easy to just converse with an AI and essentially you don&rsquo;t do the work and by work I mean coding and writing for my case.">

<p>Greetings {visitor} (I do not expect anyone reads this, so I suppose its a post just for me).</p>
<p>I have to confess something - I am not very consistent. I seem to have loads of projects, ideas or skill that I want to work on.</p>
<p>What is even worse is the AI boom that is happening at the moment. It is super easy to just converse with an AI and essentially you don&rsquo;t do the work and by work I mean coding and writing for my case.</p>
<p>My previous blog posts has been written with the assistance of AI. I want to make a change, going forward I will write it all by myself - this post included.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-is-this-habit">So, what is this habit?</h2>
<p>I spend a lot of time &lsquo;researching&rsquo; what I want to do. Currently my focus is learning to draw, but when it comes to start drawing my mind gets other ideas - Hey, let&rsquo;s make warmup generator for drawabox! That will make you&rsquo;r workflow much better. I start the project and I end up using AI to just make the project. I don&rsquo;t want to do that anymore. I got sidetracked again.</p>
<p>What I learned is the beauty of showing up. From what I recall it was called the fundamentals to the fundamentals.</p>
<p>Start to learn to show up. Make that a habit. Then build on that habit.</p>
<p>So now I have three habits I am trying to build:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drawing</li>
<li>Working out</li>
<li>Reading</li>
</ul>
<p>I am currently on my summer vacation so its easier to find the time. But I want to draw everyday, I do a drawabox warmup everyday and then I will add more when the habit is solid in place.</p>
<p>I do a beginners calisthenics workout every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I am not sure the current workout is for me, but I am trying it out and build a habit.</p>
<p>I previously had a really good habit where I read everyday when I went to bed. I am currently reading A Wheel of Time and I am on Crossroads of Twilight - have been for months now. I want to rebuild that habit and read every night again. If its just one page, so be it, baby steps.</p>
<p>Rome was not build in one day.</p>
<p>So, what do you think? Is this better than AI generated content? Hit me up if you exists.</p>
