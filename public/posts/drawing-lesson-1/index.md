**Lesson 1 from Draw A Box**

So here are the exercises and homework I have made so far in the first lesson of Draw A Box.

### Lines Homework
- **Superimposed Lines** - Practice drawing confident, straight lines
- **Ghosted Lines** - Using the ghosting method for accurate line placement  
- **Ghosted Planes** - Applying ghosting to create clean geometric shapes

### Ellipses Practice
- **Tables of Ellipses** - Drawing confident ellipses in various orientations
- **Ellipses in Planes** - Fitting ellipses within geometric constraints
- **Funnels** - Creating ellipses that align along a central axis

### Box Construction
- **Plotted Perspective** - Drawing boxes using 2-point perspective with plotted vanishing points
- **Rough Perspective** - Creating boxes in 1-point perspective without plotting
- **Rotated Boxes** - Understanding how boxes rotate in 3D space
- **Organic Perspective** - Drawing boxes at various angles and scales


**Progress Update:** Done with the exercises! Now I need to do the 250 box challenge!

*Stay tuned for the next drawings on ym journey!*
