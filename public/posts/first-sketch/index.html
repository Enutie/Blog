As you probably know, I am following the Draw a Box course and they emphasize that you also draw for fun at the side, called The 50 rule. Today, I practiced by studying a beautiful character design by wu shenyou, a professional concept artist.
My Practice Attempt

This is my beginner attempt at studying the original artwork. I know I have a long way to go, but everyone starts somewhere!">

<p><img src="moon-knight.jpeg" alt="My practice sketch"></p>
<p>This is my beginner attempt at studying the original artwork. I know I have a long way to go, but everyone starts somewhere!</p>
<h2 id="original-artwork-credit">Original Artwork Credit</h2>
<p>This practice sketch is based on the &ldquo;Moon Knight&rdquo; artwork by wu shenyou, which you can find on <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/q9ZdAD">ArtStation here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>
<p><strong>I learned, that I know nothing, Jon Snow!</strong></p>
<p>This was a very ambitious drawing, but then again, I need to challenge myself to grow. Proportions is very difficult I think, understanding how big things need to be. I think I need to study some basic anatomy or something like that to get it better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to keep learning and improving.</p>
