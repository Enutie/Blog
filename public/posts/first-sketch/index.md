# My Art Learning Journey - Day 1: Studying Knight Character Design


# Starting My Art Journey

As you probably know, I am following the Draw a Box course and they emphasize that you also draw for fun at the side, called [The 50 rule](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/2/50percent). Today, I practiced by studying a beautiful character design by wu shenyou, a professional concept artist.

## My Practice Attempt

This is my beginner attempt at studying the original artwork. I know I have a long way to go, but everyone starts somewhere!

## Original Artwork Credit

This practice sketch is based on the "Moon Knight" artwork by wu shenyou, which you can find on [ArtStation here](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/q9ZdAD).

## What I Learned

**I learned, that I know nothing, Jon Snow!**

This was a very ambitious drawing, but then again, I need to challenge myself to grow. Proportions is very difficult I think, understanding how big things need to be. I think I need to study some basic anatomy or something like that to get it better. 

I'm excited to keep learning and improving.
