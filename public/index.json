Sometimes I wonder that myself. But I have finally done it. Its liberating and now I feel kinda weird not stressing about boxes no more. I have tried to balance this challenge with the 50% rule. The rule is very clear - you have to spend at least 50 % of your time drawing on play. Play you think? That sounds easy! Well I assure you, IT IS NOT. It was so much easier to just take in some instructions and then follow them or take a reference and try and draw that too. But that is not play, that is study/course work. That resulted in me taking a long time completing this challenge and to be honest, I still have a lot of play time I need to catch up on. I have dabbled in digital as well and even got a cheap wacom drawing tablet and now that I am waiting for my feedback, I will draw some play stuff - it will indeed suck, but that is okay, I wont get any better if I don’t do it. See you in lesson 2!

But it was so much more. Here is my full review: Welcome and congratulations on finishing the first lesson of Drawabox! I’m Mada and I’ll be taking a look at your submission. Overall you did a decent job here, but I do have a bit to mention so let’s break them down one by one. I’ll write the most important things in bold. Lines Starting with your superimposed lines, these are looking good. Ghosted lines look correctly ghosted and confident too, and there are barely any arching. You’ve also demonstrated the same confidence in your ghosted planes with a great accuracy. However, I noticed that you didn’t put the start and end points when you bisect the planes horizontally and vertically. This results in floating lines, like this: https://imgur.com/a/Ud2O6tR. Do not forget to always plan your lines first when ghosting, even though you already kind of know where they should be. Ellipses Now with the tables of ellipses, you’ve demonstrated a great understanding of the concept in executing confident ellipses. However, it’s better if you had varied the ellipses more in size, shape, and degrees, as the ones you’ve done here all look similar. There are still blank space here and there, which you can snug in with more, smaller ellipses. Please use the exercise to its utmost benefit the next time you’re doing it. The ellipses in planes and funnels are nice, you drew it pretty confidently. The only problem is that you’re not really hitting the sides of the planes, making them look “floating” on the page. While accuracy is indeed less important than confidence, this is the next step that you have to really use your ellipses as you want it to. Try to touch all sides of the plane and make the ellipses fit in snugly in the funnels. Remember that these goals are there for you to practice your accuracy, so do reread these parts in case you might forgot about it. Check the examples again too if you want to see how an exercise should ideally look like. https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/ellipsesinplanes/floating https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/tablesofellipses/nogoal Boxes You’ve shown a good understanding of how to make 2 point perspective in the plotted perspective. I did see some skewed back vertical lines here and there, which is usually caused by an accumulation of human error as you plot more and more lines. I assume that’s the case and you understand that every vertical line is straight in 2 point perspective. Even if the points are not aligned correctly, try to find a middle ground and draw it as vertical as you can. You’ve applied the ghosting method and lines extension correctly for the rough perspective. I’ve noticed that some of the back faces of your boxes are not rectangular. By rectangular, we mean that they should be composed of horizontals that are parallel to the horizon line, and verticals that are perpendicular to it. While this could also be caused by the sometimes inaccurate lines, it’s worth mentioning that there should not be any arbitrary guesswork or random angles. Don’t forget that these rectangular front/back faces are the unique characteristics of 1 point perspective. (https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/20/guessing) Also try to use a colored pen for the line extensions next time, so you can differ it from your original line and analyze your mistake effectively. This is important as you will do this a lot in the box challenge, and that’s how you’ll truly improve with them. You’ve done a great job at doing the rotated boxes so far. You’ve rotated them pretty well (while making sure to move the converging lines) and used neighboring elements to deduce the next orientation of boxes, which is the whole purpose of this exercise. Unfortunately, you haven’t drawn in the boxes at each corner (you’re missing 12 boxes to be exact; refer to the example here: https://drawabox.com/lesson/1/21/example).

I have watched countless youtube videos about indie game development and there seems to be a consensus saying ‘Start small!’ and ‘Don’t make your dream game as the first game!’ So what do I do then? I found The 20 Games Challenge. The premise is that you start out small with games like pong or flappy bird and slowly work your way up to more complex games. This is also a way out of ’tutorial hell’ where you don’t essentially know how to do anything without having a tutorial to follow, here you have to use the documentation and experimentation, alternatively you can ask other people for help, but no tutorials! I like this approach and I will try and follow it, to further develop my knowledge and skills.
